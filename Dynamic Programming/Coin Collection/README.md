#Coin Collection


<p>The idea behind this program to collect maximum number of coins on an n x m board.</p>

<p>First, the program will ask a user for a text file name to read a 2-D array of a sequence of numbers. In the array, one indicates that there’s a coin on the cell, while zero means nocoin.</p>

<p>The program should will the maximum number of coins and path to collect them. <b>If there are more than two possible paths, it’s good enough to display only one of them</b>.</p>

<b>Limitation</b>
<p>The board size is less than or equal to 50 x 50.</p>
