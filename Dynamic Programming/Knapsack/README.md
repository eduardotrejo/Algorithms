#Knapsack

<p> The goal with with this program was to tackle the Knapsack problem with <i>dynamic programming</i>. </p>
<p>The program should read a weight and value of each item from the user and determine the best subset. The program will also assume that the number of items and knapsack capacity (W) are less than or equal to 15.</p>

<p>Note that the order of “Best set” in the sample run is not important. For instance, the current answer “1, 2, 4” could be “4, 2, 1” or “1, 4, 2”, “2, 1, 4”, etc.</p>
