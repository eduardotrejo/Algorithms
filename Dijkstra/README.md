#Dijkstra's Algorithm

<p>The way this program was approach was following the format that the dijkstra algorithm works. </p>
<p>First you select the starting node and calculates the value of its neighbor and then from there it continues to do the same for the rest of the nodes but calculating if a better path exists and adding the least cost to N’ until all nodes are in N’</p>
